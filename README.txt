This our first GitHub collaboration.
We're making an AWESOME website for this project.

Our ideas so far:

A website that makes travelling and everthing related more easily accessible
by providing all related data in one place by accessing other websites' APIs. 
The services (of the proposed location) are as follows ~

1. Weather update
2. Interactive map (Google map)
3. Events (Timeout)
4. Tickets (train, plane)
5. Transport (citymapper)
6. Info about travelling
	i-   Videos (Youtube, TED)
	ii-  Books (Goodreads)
	iii- Audio (Podcasts)
7. Entertainment (for commuters)
	i-  Music (Spotify)
	ii- Movies


Next: Learn how to use APIs :')
